# Simple realtime object detector

Yolo_v3 + OpenCV + Flask + memcached

Uses my own implementation of Yolo v3 detection pipeline (including own YOLOv3 detector implementation). Created this project during my study of neural network
technologies.    
The model itself (see .gitignore) can be created from original Yolo v3 weights as described here https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3#training 
 (see usage example of convert.py)
